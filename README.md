# writers-hub
Writers Hub is a blog-like website designed for writers to give them a more
professional format to display their work. It is divided by worlds, stories,
 and chapters

## Status
MVP features have been implemented. Working on formatting and improving UI

## Note
I was trying to reinvent the wheel with this project. Now that I've made it,
I would prefer to use WordPress. Still, I've demonstrated that I can build a
dynamic website using CRUD operations with a log in and search.
Also, I should have used BootStrap from the beginning. This would look a lot
better

## MVP Features
* Log in and out
* Create/edit post
* Search

## Later features
* A sidebar that includes navigation
* Also on the sidebar, there will be optional word-counts for each chapter, story, and world
* Optional comment sections at the bottom of each page
* Potentially, the ability to choose who can see which content or to make content only visible
to those who sign in
